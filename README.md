# Linux Auth Log Analyzer

A Python tool to analyze Linux authentication logs (`auth.log`) and identify suspicious login activity.

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing Linux authentication logs to help detect potentially suspicious behavior such as:
- Repeated failed login attempts
- Suspicious IP addresses
- Abnormal authentication patterns

The goal is to support basic DFIR (Digital Forensics & Incident Response) workflows by providing a simple, script-based analysis approach.

## Features (Planned / In Progress)
- Parse Linux `auth.log` files
- Extract failed and successful login attempts
- Identify repeated failed login attempts from the same IP
- Generate simple, readable output for analysis

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Regular Expressions
- Linux log files

## Project Status
🚧 Work in progress  
This project is actively being developed and will be expanded with additional features and better analysis logic.

## Usage
Details will be added once the core functionality is complete.
